AI-Powered Fall Detector: A Real-time Monitoring System

This repository contains the code for an AI-powered fall detection system that uses computer vision to monitor and identify falls in real-time. The project is built using Python and leverages popular libraries like TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Keras.

Key Features ‚öôÔ∏è
Real-time Fall Detection: The system processes video streams (from a webcam or pre-recorded footage) to detect falls as they happen.

Deep Learning Model: It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained on a custom dataset, to accurately classify human posture and identify fall events.

Alert System: Upon detecting a fall, the system can be configured to trigger an alert, making it suitable for applications in elder care or surveillance.

Modular and Scalable: The codebase is organized into modular components, making it easy to integrate into existing projects or to expand with new features.

Getting Started üöÄ
Clone the repository: git clone [repository URL]

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the detection script: python main.py

This project is a great starting point for anyone interested in computer vision, deep learning, and real-time monitoring systems. We welcome contributions and feedback!
